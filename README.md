# Base Font Fix for the Kadence Theme

WordPress plugin that adds italic variant to Kadence Theme's the base font if it is loaded from Google Fonts.

## Description

It's common to use italics in texts. For instance, it is considered best
practice to use italics for the following cases:

  - Titles of books, magazines, newspapers, pamphlets/booklets, plays,
    long poems, movies, TV shows, radio shows, musical compositions,
    choreographic works, works of visual art, comic strips, and
    software programs.
  - Name of ships, aircraft, spacecrafts, and trains.
  - Foreign words.
  - First use of key terms or phrases, often accompanied by a definition
  - Scientific names of plants and animals.
  - Words, letters, and numbers used as themselves.
  - Letters used as statistical symbols or algebraic variables

Most fonts have a carefully designed variant for italics. If available,
it is displayed by browsers. If not available, browsers fake italics by
slanting the normal variant. Such a variant is called oblique. For some
fonts, it looks acceptable. But for others, e.g. Lora, it looks awful.

Therefore, Kadence theme should include both the normal and the italic
variant of the base font, or at least give the option in the customizer to
add the italic variant. While waiting for this to be fixed in Kadence Theme,
this plugin can be used.
